# Training a Best Response with a Belief Model Hidden State Over a Pool of Hanabi Policies
This codebase is largely based off https://github.com/facebookresearch/hanabi_SAD with some modifications. The code is set up to train a best response with a belief model hidden state over a pool of 6 policies, and may be run via `python pyhanabi/selfplay.py`. Change `line 151` in `pyhanabi/selfplay.py` to modify the 6 training pool policies. Change `line 146` in `pyhanabi/selfplay.py` to modify the belief model whose hidden state we use for the best response; the belief should be such that applying the softmax function to its hidden state yields a categorical distribution over the unobservable environment features.

## Compile
We have been using `pytorch-1.5.1`, `cuda-10.1`, and `cudnn-v7.6.5` in our development environment.
Other settings may also work but we have not tested it extensively under different configurations.
We also use `conda/miniconda` to manage environments.
```bash
# create new conda env
conda create -n hanabi python=3.7
conda activate hanabi

# install pytorch
pip install torch==1.5.1+cu101 torchvision==0.6.1+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

# install other dependencies
pip install numpy
pip install psutil

# if the current cmake version is < 3.15
conda install -c conda-forge cmake
```

### Clone & Build this repo
For convenience, add the following lines to your `.bashrc`,
after the line of `conda activate xxx`.

```bash
# set path
CONDA_PREFIX=${CONDA_PREFIX:-"$(dirname $(which conda))/../"}
export CPATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/include:${CPATH}
export LIBRARY_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib:${LIBRARY_PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

# avoid tensor operation using all cpu cores
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
```

Clone & build.
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/facebookresearch/hanabi.git

cd hanabi
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j10
```

## Run

`hanabi/pyhanabi/tools` contains some example scripts to launch training
runs. `dev.sh` is a fast lauching script for debugging. It needs 2 gpus to run,
1 for training and 1 for simulation. Other scripts are examples for a more formal
training run, they require 3 gpus, 1 for training and 2 for simulation.

The important flags are:

`--sad 1` to enable "Simplified Action Decoder";

`--pred_weight 0.25` to enable auxiliary task and multiply aux loss with 0.25;

`--shuffle_color 1` to enable other-play.

```bash
cd pyhanabi
sh tools/dev.sh
```

## Trained Models

Run the following command to download the trained models used to
produce tables in the paper.
```bash
cd model
sh download.sh
```
To evaluate a model, simply run
```bash
cd pyhanabi
python tools/eval_model.py --weight ../models/sad_2p_10.pthw --num_player 2
```
